# Contributing to a dxw repository

## Behaviour and safety

We want everybody to be safe when interacting with one of our projects. So,
anybody raising an issue or opening a pull request in a dxw repository is
expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## What you can expect from dxw

dxw writes a lot of code and makes most of it publicly available. We’re happy
to share it. But we don’t always have the time to review people’s
contributions, particularly if the codebase is no longer a priority for us.

This project is not actively seeking external contributions. If you raise an
issue or open a pull request, we will do our best to respond to it, but we
can’t guarantee that we will fix or merge anything.

If you’re thinking about putting a lot of work into a pull request, and would
like to get a better idea of whether we’d consider merging it, we advise that
you first open a GitHub issue so that we can talk about it.
